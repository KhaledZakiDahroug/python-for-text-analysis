    "* Hint 1: Write a helper-function called `preprocess` which preprocesses the string (split it, remove the punctuation specified by the user, return it in a container that you think works best for the next steps). You call the function `preprocess` inside the `count` function.\n",

    "* Tip 3: Remember how we used dictionaries to count words? If not, have a look at the containers chapter. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Hint 4: Test your function using an example string which will tell you whether it fullfils the requirements (remove punctuation, split, count). You will get a point for good testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### b.) Create a python script \n",
    "\n",
    "Use your editor to create a python script called `count_words.py`. Move your function call of the **count** function to this file. Move your helper function (**preprocess**) to a seperate script which you call `utils_3a.py`. Import your helper function into `count_words.py`. Test whether everything works as expected by calling the scipt `count_words.py` from the terminal. \n",
